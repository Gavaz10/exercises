1) Child and parent have same buffer. They keep string "Hello", 
when the parent do the second printf("\n") it prints "Hello" and "\n"from. 
At the same time when child do printf("\n"), it prints "Hello" and "\n".

2) Parent prints on the screen "Hello\n", 
after fork child keeps "\n", and when it do printf("\n"),
it prints first "\n" from the buffer and current "\n".
